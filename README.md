# socket-chat

This web app provides a multi-channel chat environment similar to Slack, but with end-to-end encryption. It makes use of 
the socket.io library and a Node.js environment to facilitate instantenous, event-based communcation via HTTP. It also makes
use of AWS Lambda optimizations for uniform image resampling and storage on an AWS-based MySQL database backend.
